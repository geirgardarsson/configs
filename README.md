# Configs and setup
The purpose of this repo is to store my dev setup, configs and scripts, which I can grab when I need to set up a new machine.

## Tools
Tools and plugins I frequently use:
- [Autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump)
- [Lazyvim plugin manager](https://www.lazyvim.org/installation)
- [zsh autosuggestions (like fish)](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/tree/master)
